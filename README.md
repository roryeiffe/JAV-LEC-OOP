### Completion Time
- 30 Minutes

### Lecture Focus
- Object Oriented Programming - Focus on how we can write code to model real-world objects
- Classes - the blueprints for how our objects will be created, including methods and fields
- Constructors - in addition to talking about fields and methods in general, it is important to explain what a constructor is, because they are necessary to create objects
- Objects - the instances of classes, can have state, can invoke methods
- Benefits of OOP - Make sure to emphasize why OOP is important and widely used

### Prerequisites
- Associates should have a fundamental idea of programming and should have worked with primitive data types and Strings before, as primitives will be used as fields in classes.
- Before introducing the idea of classes, trainer might want to showcase an example of using primitives to represent real-world objects (i.e. instead of making a Car class wih 3 fields, store the 3 fields as separate variables) It is important to note how tedious this becomes without the use of a class to encapsulate this information.

### Learning Objectives
- Trainer might want to *avoid* talking about the Object Class, as the wording of this class could be confusing to associates who are just now learning about objects and classes.
- By the end of this lecture, associates should have an understanding of what classes and objects are. Associates should also understand the importance of Object-Oriented Programming and some of its basic use cases.

### Related Content
- Some of the earlier exercises found [here](https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/oop/index.php) might help the associates get practice writing classes and objects. 
- The [JAV-GCE-OOP](https://revature0.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/trainers/Shared%20Documents/Line%20Of%20Business/1.%20Units/Core%20Java/Core%20Java%20Unit%20Breakdown.xlsx?d=w6a2dcdffed1f438c86de3379040af09a&csf=1&web=1&e=AE1zpI&nav=MTJfSjM0X3swMDAwMDAwMC0wMDAxLTAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwMDAwMDAwMDB9) would be a good activity to use in order to show off working with OOP in Java.

 ### Discussion Questions
- What are the benefits of OOP?
- What are some limitations of OOP?
- What are some problems for which OOP is a good approach?
- What are some problems for which OOP is *not* a good approach?
